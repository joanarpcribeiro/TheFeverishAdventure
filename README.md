# TheFeverishAdventure

This RPG game is just a taster. It takes us back to the 90s, 
when the games of the "Choose your own Adventure" style were just blooming, and we had heroes that were very pixelized.

I loved those games, so I wanted to create something of that sort.

This was done as a first final project for Ironhack, Lisbon campus.
